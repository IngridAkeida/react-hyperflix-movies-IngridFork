# HyperFlix React App

I'm delighted to share the result of my project on [Hyper Island's](https://www.instagram.com/hyperislandapplicants/HyperIsland) ReactJS course, in which I was able to work in partnership and improve my hard and soft skills, In this project I dedicated myself to experiencing everything that was proposed to me, and I was then able to further qualify in ReactJs using it at more advanced levels of complexity, and also have the opportunity to work in TailwindCSS for the first time. 

All these values acquired during this module make me more confident to be the professional I seek to be as a FrontEnd Developer.
